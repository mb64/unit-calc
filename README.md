# unit-calc
Tags numbers with unit types to enforce dimentional accuracy of calculations

It uses a plethora of GHC extentions, and surprisingly little code, to accomplish this goal at compile time. All the work's in `UnitCalc.hs`, but there are a couple extremely simple examples in `Main.hs`.
It's probably most useful just for using GHCi as a caculator right now, but I might add more in the future.
